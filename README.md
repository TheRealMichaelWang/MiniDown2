# MiniDown2
A small markup language made for the HRL interview.

## Requirements
### Goal 2
- It parses correctly and doesn't crash
- Some additional test cases can be found in [tests](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/tree/master/tests)
### Goal 2
- [out.html - the emitted HTML output](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/blob/master/tests/out.html)
### Goal 3
- [test.pdf - the file without the rendered by message](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/blob/master/tests/test.pdf)
- [test.md](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/blob/master/tests/test.md)
### Goal 4 - Rendering
- [exercies.pdf - the file with the rendered by message](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/blob/master/tests/exercise.pdf)

## Running the Code
The project was written in C# (.NET 6) because of it's reliability, and portability. It can generate executables for either UNIX and windows.

I've compiled some pre-built binaries that can be downloaded, and run; you can [grab them here](https://github.com/TheRealMichaelWang/MiniDown2/releases/tag/1).

### Compiling and Building the Software
- There are UNIX alternatives for compiling .NET programs, such as Mono
- Using Visual Studio will probably work better
  - Need to have .NET 6 SDK
- Just open the .sln file in visual studio
- Click run
